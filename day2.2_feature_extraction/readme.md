# Feature extraction

In this chapter we will introduce measurements of segmented objects in microscopy images. We will measure intensity, size and shape of objects using two napari plugins that can also be used from Python:
* [napari-skimage-regionprops](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-skimage-regionprops/)
* [napari-simpleitk-image-processing](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-simpleitk-image-processing)

You can download the slides [here](Feature_Extraction.pdf).
