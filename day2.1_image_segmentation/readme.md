# Image segmentation

In this session we will cover basic image segmentation techniques such as Otsu's thresholding method and connected component labeling. We will also introduce common short-cuts such as Voronoi-Otsu-Labeling. To simplify things, we will use napari and the napari-assistant to setup image segmentation notebooks.
